# 2D plots to 3D surfaces by revolution

This repository contains functions and a demonstrative notebook which can be used to convert 2D axial symmetric plots into 3D surfaces with ease.

## 2D function:

## Possible 3D surfaces:

## Prerequisite

Essential libraries required for the simulation are the common ones: numpy, scipy, math and matplotlib. 

In order to covert the created 3D surface into a meshed surface (format compatable with CAD, Adobe Dimension etc. ) which can be later used for engineering as well as 
3D printing applications, please install the library [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/)

## Usage/Examples
A notebook explaining the use of the simple library is included [here](https://github.com/meghanad-kayanattil/2D-to-3D-by-axial-revolutions/blob/main/Demonstrative%20examples.ipynb) 

## References
The repository is inspired by the lack of a functionlaity like Cylinder() in Matlab for Python
